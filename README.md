# PHP
PHP BASIC 


 PHP is the most popular server-side language used to build dynamic websites, and though it is a very extensive language, this class will take it step-by-step.

The stateless web (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) can only do so much without a dynamic language such as PHP to add the ability to interact with the web server.

You will learn how to make your pages dynamic based upon user interaction, interacting with HTML forms and store and retrieve information from local data sources which include a database.

Objectives for this class:
* Understand how server-side programming works on the web.
* PHP Basic syntax for variable types and calculations.
* Creating conditional structures
* Storing data in arrays
* Using PHP built-in functions and creating custom functions
* Understanding POST and GET in form submission.
* How to receive and process form submission data.
* Reading and writing cookies.
* Security tips (i.e. SQL Injection)
* Create a database in phpMyAdmin.
* Read and process data in a MySQL database.
